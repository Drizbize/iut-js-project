# Pixel Coin Game Project

This project is a client-side web application that interacts with a game server to visualize and manipulate a grid of pixels. Each pixel may have a color indicating the presence of a coin or an action taken by a user. Users can perform various actions such as searching for coins, taking or stealing them, and checking team and bank status.

## Overview

The game lets players participate in a pixel-based treasure hunt. Players interact with the grid through buttons, which trigger requests to the server. Teams compete to collect coins and store them in banks.
